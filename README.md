New Post
    Click on the "New Post" button in the navbar on the top of the screen to access this pop up.
    Within the pop up you must enter a title and text in the description in order to be able to succesfully create a post.
    You can add whatever title, description, images, or tags that you wish.
    When adding an image it will show up just as the title of the image, however when you preview the post the actual image will appear.
    You can save your draft which will allow you to close out the new post pop up, and when you click new post again the post will still be there.
    Once you've created a post you like you can click the "Preview and post" button which will bring you to the post preview, from there you can click either post button to post it.
    Once you've made a post, you can see it in the personal profile page.

Search
    Search by using the search bar in the navbar at the top. Our search is fully functional so feel free to search whatever you like, however since our database
    is pretty small, we recommend searching up something simple like just the letter "h" to see the full functionality with a lot of search results. From there
    you may click whichever result you like and be taken to the corresponding page.

    You can reach the notifications page by clicking on the bell icon in the navbar on the top of the screen. This will bring you to a pop up with a list of three
